In Python, data can be grouped in categories called Types

| Name | Example |
| ---      | ---           |
| `string`   | "hello"
| `list`      | `[1,2,3,4]`      |
| `integers or int` | `1 ` `-10 ` `23 `|
| `float` | `3.5 ``-3.5 ``1.0`

An example of using these type of data:

```python
favourite_food = "tempura"
my age = 16.5 # my age is a type of integer or int
```
